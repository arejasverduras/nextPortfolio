The original, vanilla **JavaScript only** version of the 'Koekboek'.

I've rebuild this app with **React, Redux** and **TypeScript** for some practice after finishing my *codecademy* career path.

[Find the React version here](https://next-portfolio-remake.vercel.app/projects/koekboek)

Using the classic example of a recipe-book, I wanted to be able to hit a button and get a random recipe, making it easier for me to choose what to prepare on my cookings days.

_The first version of koekboek was quite funky_

_I really like box shadows. It reminds me of Super Mario 3_

It was quite a lot of lines of code to have a single recipe 'component' update its data using only JavaScript and **no JSX**. 

I even wrote some 'element generator' functions to make it easier to update elements.

_..that's a lot of code_

After building this, **JSX** and **React** were introduced in my codecademy bootcamp, and i got a big "Ahhhhh.... " moment. 

After finishing the bootcamp and additionaly learning **TypeScript**, I rebuild my recipe book in **React** with **TypeScript** and **Redux**. 

> _'Kook' is an english term for a beginner surfer. It also means 'to cook' in Dutch. Pronounced phonetically, you say 'koek'._

Still, my favorite feature must have been: 
`makeFlashy(element)`

_..I guess i did not understand promises and setInterval back then_
