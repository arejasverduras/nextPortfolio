A remake in **React** of my first **JavaScript-only** interactive app. 
Using the classic example of a recipe-book, I wanted to be able to hit a button and get a random recipe, making it easier for me to choose what to cook on my cookings days.

[Find the original JavaScript only Koekboek here (recommended)](https://next-portfolio-remake.vercel.app/projects/koekboek-original)
